*an exporter tool by Andrew Crowell <<overkill9999@gmail.com>>*

Verge is an interesting game creation tool, but the tools are somewhat lacking especially in the map department. maped3 is kind of crappy. It would be nice to instead edit maps with [tiled](http://mapeditor.org), a decent map editor tool which works on multiple platforms and *doesn't* require the .NET framework. Thankfully, you're in luck.

The `v3tiled` package comes with a set of tools for converting maped3 formats into tiled-friendly formats, and vice-versa.    
**Please! See [this wiki](http://wiki.github.com/Bananattack/v3tiled/) for more information on the various tool usage and more information about file formats specifications and export details.**
